Now we are creating map using geojson. First we create a base map, second step is to figure out what to put on it. Show distribution of a certain plant or its circulation, or highlight a certain part of the map. Now we are creating map layers. First we highlight a region on geojson eg one of the tea growing regions in China. Then click on the polygon icon. Then click copy on coding. Then go to github and save map to a new file, with file name ending in ".json". Click preview then click "raw".
