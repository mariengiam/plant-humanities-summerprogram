### Tea and the *Camellia sinensis*

"Tea" has come to encapsulate a multitude of meanings: colloquial, cultural and even meanings specific to particular generations of people. At its most basic, tea refers to a beverage prepared by pouring hot water over leaves from the tea plant, the *Camellia sinensis*, native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. From the tea plant, six major types of tea are produced: black tea, white tea, oolong tea, green tea, dark and pu-er tea, all of which requires different processing methods.

There are [two varieties](https://www.kew.org/plants/tea-plant) of *Camellia sinensis*: the *Camellia sinensis var. sinensis* and the *Camellia sinensis var. assamica*, with the latter getting its name from the Assam region of northeastern India where is it widespread. Both varieties are [different](https://youngmountaintea.com/blogs/blog/sinensis-vs-assamica?srsltid=AfmBOopAsEJoRXVYSxncbVLeMiiXHkEyZdQrs8JUjWVd7lYo2b8VFkB-) in appearance: while the *Camellia sinensis var. sinensis* has leaves that are more tender and small, the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis var. assamica* are larger and more robust. In terms of taste, tea produced by processing leaves of the *Sinensis* variety are known to have "flora, fruity and sometimes sweet notes" whereas tea of the *Assam* variety are often characterised as being "stronger, bolder and darker". Popular "teas" like chamomile, rooibos and peppermint do not derive from the *Camellia sinensis* plant but rather, are herbal infusions of other plants.

### What is "tea"? 

The first recorded instance of the word tea in English appeared in 1658 in the *Mercurius Politicus*, an English newspaper. Calling it the "China drink", Thomas Garraway in advertising the qualities of tea on behalf of his coffee-house wrote about: "That excellent and by all Physicians, approved, China drink, called by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay alias Tee, is sold at the Sultaness Head Coffee-House, in Sweetings Rents, by the Royal Exchange, London."

The transliteration of the Chinese character for tea "茶" was "tcha", or cha but "tay" was not, as Garroway thought, a translation of "tcha" into a different language. Rather "tay" was a spoken variation of the Chinese character "茶" in Hokkien, a dialect commonly spoken among in the Chinese in the Southern Chinese province of Fujian, a historically important trading port.

In the seventeenth century, Dutch merchants trading in the Southern Chinese province of Fujian must have encountered local Fujianese merchants using the dialect term "tay" instead of "cha". It is possible they adopted this term. "Tay" was absorbed into the Dutch lexicon as "thee" which was pronounced exactly the same way as the Fujianese would have pronounced "tay". In turn the English borrowed directly from the Dutch word "thee", to become "tea".

### The practice of tea drinking

The practice of tea drinking originates in China and the Chinese attribute the "discovery" of tea consumption to the mythological figure, Shennong, the Divine Husbandman (2737–2697 BCE). This painting on the right, by the sixteenth century Ming dynasty painter, Guo Xu (1456–1532), depicts Shennong tasting the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant for its medicinal value. That Shennong was a healer who was interested in plants of medicinal value is corroborated by the father of the Chinese *bencao* medical tradition, Li Shizhen, in his *Bencao gangmu* (Compendium of Materia Medica) who claims that Shennong tasted hundreds of plants in a search for ones of medicinal value.[^1]

The earliest known physical evidence of tea being consumed was in the second century BC. Archaeologists discovered a mass of partially-decomposed plants, which scientists identified as tea, in the mausoleum of [Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-find-worlds-oldest-tea-tomb-han-dynasty-emperor-180957790/) in Xian who ruled China over 2000 years ago. This finding indicates that tea from the *Camellia sinensis* was being consumed by Chinese emperors as early as the second century BC.

### Tea and material culture: rituals, ceremonies, traditions

As tea consumption spread, so too did rituals and ceremonies associated with tea. From handleless cups with a wide circumference used for both its preparation and consumption, vessels used to drink tea multiplied in shape and form. In Japan, ceramicware was used for the [*chanoyu*](https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/the-japanese-tea-ceremony): a Japanese ceremonial ritual of tea preparation and consumption, in a specialised space with codified procedures. In Europe, the popularity of Chinese blue and white [*jingdezhen* porcelain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingdezhen_porcelain) led to the creation of Delftware, a type of tin-glazed earthenware, and finally to the success of ["hardpaste"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-paste_porcelain) porcelain in Meissen, Germany. Today, the revived and much popularised British tradition of afternoon tea with scones, cake, sandwiches and tea (of course!) reminds us of the various ways in which traditions and rituals survive and revive, and the transformations that take place in the process.

### Dutch curiosity: Early European encounters with tea

Dutch East India Company (VOC) merchants and affiliates were crucial to the spread of tea to the rest of Europe, providing the impetus for the events that unfolded in thr nineteenth century. News about tea drinking as well as the commodity itself came to British Isles through Dutch literary sources and directly from their trade with Dutch merchants.[^2] As Markman Ellis remarks, "tea sociability was a conspicuous aspect of Dutch influence on British social life."[^3] Since 1609, the Japanese granted the VOC trading rights with Japan via the island of Deshima, becoming the only Europeans to successfully establish a trading post in Japan. Through their presence in Japan, they were also able to gain a foothold into the China trade, including the trade in tea. Thus, they became the first Europeans to import tea into Europe from Asia.

On 2 October 1609, the first batch of tea consisting of tea leaves and green powdered tea, set sail to Holland on the *Rood Leeuw met Piljen* (red lion with arrows), via the Dutch controlled port of Bantam, Indonesia.[^4] The Dutch would continue to monopolise the trade in tea until the end of the seventeenth century. The English merchant, William Milburn thus noted that:

	   src="wc:Kist_met_negen_flessen-Rijksmuseum_NG-444.jpeg"
	   caption="Tea Cannisters Bearing the VOC Label">

>"The Dutch East India Company were unquestionably the first who engaged in tea as an article of commerce; and from the beginning until near the close of the seventeenth century, the whole of European demand was supplied through the medium of their sales."[^5]

The English would continue to rely on the Dutch for their supply of tea either from Batavia or from Dutch middlemen in Asia until 1717 when they began shipping tea to England directly from Canton, China.[^6] Nevertheless, tea was still a luxury item that was imported in small quantities, "one exotic commodity in an array of goods traded by the VOC."[^7] Accompanying the introduction of tea as a commodity was a curiosity in the way tea was prepared and consumed. The German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer (1651-1716), who was chief surgeon of the VOC in Deshima includes a section on the tea plant in his *History of Japan*. He also provides illustrations on how tea should be stored and prepared, and utensils used in these processes. As Kaempfer was stationed in Japan when he made these observations, they provide insight into Japanese traditions of processing and drinking tea.

Dutch physicians and medical writers were also interested in the medicinal qualities and effects of tea on human physiology. Apart from Kaempfer, other writers include Nicolaes Tulp (1593–1674), Cornelis Bontekoe (1640–1685) and William Ten Rhijne (1647 – 1700). As Kaempfer’s predecessor, Ten Rhijne wrote the first detailed study of tea, *De Frutice Thee* (On the tea bush), published in 1678 as an appendix to Dutch merchant and naturalist Jacob Breyne’s treatise, *Exoticum plantarum centuria prima* (First Century of Exotic Plants). Ten Rhijne’s *De Fructice Thee* includes a long section extolling the "virtues of tea", where he observed that tea "…purifies the blood, drives away dreadful sleeplessness, wards off malicious vapors from the brain, mitigates vertigo and headaches (especially those arising from a hangover), and is beneficial for dropsy patients, for it is an excellent diuretic." Through these writings, knowledge about the commercial and medicinal value of tea spread together with tea drinking habits, culminating in the political and environmental legacies of the nineteenth century.
