### Tea and the *Camellia sinensis*

"Tea" has come to encapsulate a variety of different colloquial, cultural and even meanings specific to particular generations. At its most basic, tea refers to a beverage prepared by pouring hot water over leaves from the tea plant, the *Camellia sinensis*, native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. From the tea plant, six major types of tea are produced: black tea, white tea, oolong tea, green tea, dark and pu-er tea, all of which requires different processing methods.

There are [two varieties](https://www.kew.org/plants/tea-plant) of *Camellia sinensis*: the *Camellia sinensis var. sinensis* and the *Camellia sinensis var. assamica*, with the latter getting its name from the Assam region of northeastern India where is it widespread. Both varieties are [different](https://youngmountaintea.com/blogs/blog/sinensis-vs-assamica?srsltid=AfmBOopAsEJoRXVYSxncbVLeMiiXHkEyZdQrs8JUjWVd7lYo2b8VFkB-) in appearance: while the Camellia sinensis var. sinensis has leaves that are more tender and small, the leaves of the Camellia sinensis var. assamica are larger and more robust. In terms of taste, tea produced by processing leaves of the camellia sinensis var. sinensis plant are known to have "flora, fruity and sometimes sweet notes" whereas tea of the Assam variety are often charaterised as being "stronger, bolder and darker". Popular "teas" like chamomile, rooibos and peppermint do not derive from the *Camellia sinensis* plant but rather, are herbal infusions of other plants.

### What is "tea"? 

The first recorded instance of the word tea in English appeared in 1658 in the *Mercurius Politicus*, an English newspaper. Calling it the "China drink", Thomas Garraway in advertising the qualities of tea on behalf of his coffee-house wrote about: "That excellent and by all Physicians, approved, China drink, called by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay alias Tee, is sold at the Sultaness Head Coffee-House, in Sweetings Rents, by the Royal Exchange, London."

The transliteration of the Chinese character for tea "茶" was "tcha", or cha but "tay" was not, as Garroway thought, a translation of "tcha" into a different language. Rather "tay" was a spoken variation of the Chinese character "茶" in Fujianese, a dialect commonly spoken among in the Chinese in the Southern Chinese province of Fujian, a historically important trading port.

In the seventeenth century, Dutch merchants trading in the Southern Chinese province of Fujian must have encountered local Fujianese merchants using the dialect term "tay" instead of "cha". It is possible they adopted this term. "Tay" was absorbed into the Dutch lexicon as "thee" which was pronounced exactly the same way as the Fujianese would have pronounced "tay". In turn the English borrowed directly from the Dutch word "thee", to become "tea".

### The practice of tea drinking

The practice of tea drinking originates in China and the Chinese attribute the "discovery" of tea consumption to the mythological figure, Shennong, the Divine Husbandman (2737–2697 BCE), also believed to be the first Chinese emperor. This painting on the right, by the sixteenth century Ming dynasty painter, Guo Xu (1456–1532), depicts Shennong tasting the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant for its medicinal value. That Shennong was a healer who was interested in plants of medicinal value is corroborated by the father of the Chinese *bencao* medical tradition, Li Shizhen, in his *Bencao gangmu* (Compendium of Materia Medica) who claims that the mythical Shennong tasted hundreds of plants in a search for ones of medicinal value.

The earliest known physical evidence of tea being consumed was in the second century BC. Archaeologists discovered a mass of partially-decomposed plants, which scientists identified as tea, in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi'an who ruled China over 2000 years ago. This finding indicates that tea from the Camellia sinensis was being consumed by Chinese emperors as early as the second century BC.

### Material culture of tea: cups and vessels 

As tea drinking spread, so too did tea drinking vessels and equipment. Although tea was initially drunk from from handleless cups with a wide circumference used for both its preparation and consumption, vessels used to drink tea transformed in shape and size, as tea spread to Japan, Europe, the Middle East and the Americas through trade, migration and colonialism. 

### Dutch curiosity: Early European encounters with tea

Dutch East India Company merchants and affiliates were crucial to the spreading of knowledge about and stimulating interest in tea and tea drinking, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries.
