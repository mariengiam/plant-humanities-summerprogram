# What is "tea"?

What is "tea"? From black tea to herbal tisanes and "boba" tea, the term "tea" has come to encapsulate a variety of different colloquial, cultural and generational meanings. At its most basic, tea making often refers to a beverage prepared by pouring hot water over leaves from the tea plant, the camellia sinensis, native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. From the tea plant, 6 major types of tea are produced: black tea, white tea, oolong tea, green tea, dark and pu-er tea, all of which requires different processing methods.

There are two species of the tea plant grown today: the camellia sinensis var. sinensis and the Camellia sinensis var. assamica. While popular infusions like chamomile, rooibos and peppermint are all marketed as "tea", they are herbal infusions of other plants, and do not derive from the camellia sinensis plant.
