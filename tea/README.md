# What is "tea"?

The word "tea" has come to encapsulate a variety of different colloquial, cultural and generation-specific meanings. At its most basic, tea refers to a beverage prepared by pouring hot water over leaves from the tea plant, the *Camellia sinensis*, native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. From the tea plant, 6 major types of tea are produced: black tea, white tea, oolong tea, green tea, dark and pu-er tea, all of which requires different processing methods.

There are two species of the tea plant grown today: the *Camellia sinensis var. sinensis* and the *Camellia sinensis var. assamica*. While popular infusions like chamomile, rooibos and peppermint are all marketed as "tea" today, they do not derive from the *Camellia sinensis* plant and are herbal infusions of other plants.[Tea plant - Camellia sinensis | Plants | Kew]

# *Camellia sinensis*


There are two varies of Camellia sinensis: the *Camellia sinensis var. sinensis* and the *Camellia sinensis var. assamica*, with the latter getting its name from the Assam region of northeastern India where is it widespread. Both varieties are different in appearance: while the Camellia sinensis var. sinensis has leaves that are more tender and small, the leaves of the Camellia sinensis var. assamica are larger and more robust. In terms of taste, tea produced by processing leaves of the camellia sinensis var. sinensis plant are known to have "flora, fruity and sometimes sweet notes" whereas tea of the Assam variety are often charaterised as being "stronger, bolder and darker".[Sinensis Vs.

# Where does the word "tea" derive from?

The first recorded instance of the word "tea" in English appeared in 1658 in the Mercurius Politicus, an English newspaper. Calling it the "China drink", Thomas Garraway in advertising the qualities of tea on behalf of his coffee-house wrote about:

>"That excellent and by all Physicians, approved, China drink, called by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay alias Tee, is sold at the Sultaness Head Coffee-House, in Sweetings Rents, by the Royal Exchange, London."

The Chinese word for tea was "tcha", or cha茶, but "tay" was not, as Garroway thought, a translation of "tcha" into a different language, but rather a variation of the Chinese word, cha 茶 in Fujianese, a dialect used by Chinese in the Southern Chinese province of Fujian.

in the 17th century, Dutch merchants trading in the Southern Chinese province of Fujian must have encountered Fujianese merchants using the term "tay" instead of "cha", and adopted this term. "Tay" was absorbed and transformed into the Dutch lexicon as "thee". In turn the English borrowed directly from the Dutch word "thee", to become "tea".
