# What is "tea"?

What is "tea"? From black tea to herbal tisanes and "boba" tea, the term "tea" has come to encapsulate a variety of different colloquial, cultural and generational meanings. At its most basic, tea making often refers to a beverage prepared by pouring hot water over leaves from the tea plant, the *Camellia sinensis*, native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. From the tea plant, 6 major types of tea are produced: black tea, white tea, oolong tea, green tea, dark and pu-er tea, all of which requires different processing methods.

There are two species of the tea plant grown today: the *Camellia sinensis var. sinensis* and the *Camellia sinensis var. assamica*. While popular infusions like chamomile, rooibos and peppermint are all marketed as "tea", they are herbal infusions of other plants, and do not derive from the camellia sinensis plant.
